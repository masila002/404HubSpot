# 17 — Backend API foundation and contracts

Status: PLANNED; not implemented in feature 01. Owner: backend.
Branch: `feature/backend/17-api-foundation` — create from freshly fetched `origin/main` only after dependencies merge.
One root spec, one feature branch, one PR; affected layers share this vertical outcome.

## Problem and outcome

Introduce the smallest backend needed for durable inquiries and content operations.

## Dependencies and readiness

Required merged specs: 02,16. Read [architecture](../../docs/architecture/SYSTEM-DESIGN.md),
[roadmap](../../docs/planning/IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md), root tracker and affected contracts.
Before code: Hosting/runtime choice, budget and operational owner. Unresolved external facts remain explicit gates; never fabricate them.
Confirm current provider/library versions from official sources at implementation and record date.

## Owned files and layer boundaries

Proposed files: backend/AGENTS.md; backend/package.json; backend/src/app.ts; backend/src/modules/; docs/contracts/openapi.yaml.
Create only files needed by this outcome. Preserve existing source layout and public URLs.
Owner/consumer documents update together; do not introduce unrelated layer scaffolding.

## Behavior and implementation sequence

1. Validate Node LTS/TypeScript/Fastify compatibility using current official docs, then pin supported dependencies.
2. Create application-service/module boundaries, configuration validation, health/readiness endpoints and request IDs.
3. Define OpenAPI errors/validation/versioning and same-origin API routing; keep frontend runtime untouched.
4. Add shutdown/timeouts and redacted structured logging; readiness reflects actual dependencies, not a constant green response.

## Data, contracts and permissions

Formalize draft FUTURE-PLATFORM HTTP contract; no public endpoint may grant staff permissions.
Record schema/interface changes in the canonical contract and update consumers in the same PR.
No secrets or production user data in fixtures. All privileged actions authorize on the server.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Backend starts from documented commands and fails clearly on invalid config.
- [ ] Health/readiness behavior is tested during dependency failure.
- [ ] Error responses match schemas and contain no stack traces/secrets.
- [ ] Existing frontend build and static contact fallback still work independently.

## Verification and evidence

Backend typecheck/build; API schema and lifecycle integration tests; frontend regression. Record exact new commands in this spec before coding.
Before implementation, register exact executable commands for newly introduced tooling in the
stack contract and this spec. Run existing `npm run build` and `git diff --check` where frontend
changes apply. Record revision, environment, pass/fail/skip counts and unavailable operator gates.
For visible UI, capture relevant mobile/desktop states including failures; for APIs/tools, include
negative access and failure tests. Do not claim unrun integration or provider checks as passed.

## Rollout, rollback and completion

Deploy initially without switching inquiry traffic; rollback by disabling API routing, not deleting frontend.
Update the root tracker and any changed layer responsibility/contract before pushing this branch.
Present concrete evidence for review; do not merge or begin the next spec without the user's decision.
