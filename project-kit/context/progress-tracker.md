# Progress tracker — 404HubSpot

## 0. Execution chain

Current: 01 merged to `main` (`cb5d263`); 02b unified revamp IN PROGRESS on `feature/web/02-unified-site-revamp` (owner-approved bundle of 02–09,12,33 + Clerk/GSAP/Lottie/font/pricing).
Next eligible after user review/merge: 02 content truth confirmation (prices/team/keys), then remaining staged specs one-by-one.
One spec/branch/PR normally; 02b is a documented single exception — do not batch further without approval.

Rule: implement strictly in dependency order, one spec per branch. 02b is the single documented exception.

## 2. Delivered scope

- Baseline existing-project generator created only missing project-owned planning; original source
  layout, package manifest/lockfile and hosting configs remain intact.
- Redesigned hero, navigation, six service cards, M-Pesa feature, training, process, four-person
  team, closing CTA and footer. Existing nine routes and detail-page bodies preserved.
- Shared service/inquiry data, accessible disclosures, cleanup on unmount, skip links, hash/top
  scrolling, safe external-link attributes, initials for absent team portraits, existing logo favicon.
- Copied 23 supplied images and four upstream design reference documents; authored project-specific
  catalogue, design system, tokens, UI rules/registry and editable desktop/mobile HTML design board.
- User follow-ups expanded supporting documentation to 33 feature specs, eight logical ownership
  kits, modular full-stack architecture, data model, API/MCP/AI contracts, threat model and operations.
- Backend, database, admin, AI, MCP, hosting provisioning, mobile and microservices are NOT built.

## 3. Verification

### 3a. Feature 01 (merged to main `cb5d263`) — historical record

Tested source based on fetched origin/main `16f9a7a72351f2b4226b200aed1b6587f820586e`.
Exact working-source fingerprint: `af24480e670ea51a1e10a6437c8439ae9a34a76ace61179ac1edd08b0e67d19a`.
Per-file hashes: docs/design/evidence/source-snapshot.json; the feature commit contains this snapshot.

- `npm run build`: PASS; 48 modules; 0 errors; CSS 41.69 kB (8.94 gzip), JS 187.77 kB
  (54.28 gzip), HTML 1.03 kB. Two existing warning categories: caniuse-lite age and module-type inference.
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE=/home/artkins/sababisha/node_modules/playwright CHROMIUM_PATH=/home/artkins/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-1140/chrome-linux/chrome node scripts/verify-ui.cjs`:
  PASS, 57 grouped checks, including 45 combinations of nine routes × 360/768/1024/1440/1920px.
  Zero runtime page errors; no horizontal overflow; landing images loaded; menu keyboard/Escape/
  outside-click/route-close/resize, skip links, anchors and reduced motion verified.
- Playwright 1.63.0 with installed Chromium 130.0.6723.31. No project dependency installed.
- Seven primary text contrast pairs: PASS, minimum 5.22:1; not a full accessibility certification.
- Planning audit: 193 local links resolved; 33 specs; eight layer kits; dependency graph acyclic.
- Inspiration audit: 23 images byte-identical to provided source (SHA-256).
- `git diff --check`: PASS. Manifest, lockfile and hosting configuration diffs: empty.
- Browser captures: docs/design/evidence/landing-{360,768,1024,1440,1920}.png.

### 3b. Feature 02b unified revamp (this branch, 2026-09-30)
- `npm run build`: PASS; 102 modules; 0 errors. Warnings only: caniuse-lite age, lottie eval notice (module-type warning fixed via `"type": "module"`).
- `verify-ui.cjs`: PASS, 75 grouped checks (60 route×viewport: 12 routes × 360/768/1024/1440/1920 + theme/contrast/interaction). Zero runtime errors; no overflow; skip links, menu/disclosure keyboard, anchors, reduced motion (robust wait), theme toggle UI verified.
- Team detail fix: App.vue transition close-tag + TeamDetail import paths corrected after dev-server report; stale Vite processes killed so `:5173` is the tested server.
- GitHub verify 2026-09-30 (api.github.com): DonArtkins 69 repos/63 followers; masila002 35/21; kiki-glow 46/10 + portfolio URL; Ericnjuki254 6/20; chemii933 10/14.
- Favicon set (owner-supplied, public/favicon/) moved to public/ root so Vercel serves /favicon.ico, /apple-touch-icon.png, /site.webmanifest; manifest rebranded 404HubSpot; vercel.json SPA rewrites added. Per-route SEO via src/lib/seo.js (title/desc/canonical/OG/Twitter, auth noindex, JSON-LD); sitemap.xml + robots.txt; domain provisional (VITE_SITE_URL).
- Visibility/theme (bugs/UI-VISIBILITY.png): flow-bottom pair declared (#f8faf4 on #314d42); full theme token remap + fixed illustration palette; `verify-ui.cjs` asserts 7 pairs ≥ 4.5 in light AND dark via the real toggle UI. Measured — light min 5.22, dark min 8.80.
- Auth RETIRED 2026-09-30 per owner order: nav link, plugin, routes, pages, dep removed; `.env` Clerk keys removed; plan + lessons in spec 34 (fullstack phase).
- Contact + newsletter are BACKEND (owner order 2026-09-30): runtime Brevo code removed (`brevo.js`, `NewsletterForm`, `ResultModal`); Contact validates + hands prefilled inquiries to WhatsApp. Plan lives in spec 19 + `docs/integrations/BREVO*.md` + `emails/` templates.
- Courses from GitHub evidence: 12 tracks in `src/data/courses.js`, `/classes/:slug` detail pages (syllabus, mentor, repo evidence, prev/next); class index links every track. All 6 services cross-linked on every service detail page. 404 page with Lottie + actions, noindex.
- 404 page (`/:pathMatch(.*)*`): landing-styled lost-and-found with Lottie (`src/assets/lottie/notfound.json`), action buttons + popular destinations, noindex.
- Pricing bands provisional (search integration down, no Context7) — owner confirmation gates quotes.
- Evidence refresh 2026-09-30: `docs/design/evidence/landing-{360,768,1024,1440,1920}.png` regenerated; `npm run build` PASS (69 modules, 0 errors; CSS 38.54 kB / JS 325.19 kB + lottie 307.91 kB); `git diff --check` PASS.

## 4. Contract synchronization and deviations

Updated public-navigation contract, canonical UI tokens/rules/registry, owner and consumer context,
feature spec and README. Source paths/services/contact destinations synchronized via src/data/site.js.
Route shapes unchanged; new scroll behavior documented. Existing detail styles remain scoped apart.
Future platform contracts are explicitly drafts, not implemented APIs. Layer kits route status here.
No baseline .baseline/Husky/CI workflow tree injected; baseline tooling remains in its source repo.
No Figma file created: editable local HTML board and actual screenshots provide review artifacts.
Official documentation fallback used because no Context7 MCP tool was available; sources are in spec.

## 5. Open limits and next action

02b review/merge: OPEN. Owner must confirm: Glory Kinya photo/bio/links; Frank “Fullstack Developer & Designer” and Don “AI Engineer & System Architect” titles; provisional KES bands; Brevo sender/key/inbox + Meet ID. Clerk publishable key LIVE (verified rendering 2026-09-30); `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` + `clerk auth login`/`clerk link` remain for backend (spec 19). Production deployment not run.
Existing Contact form/meeting placeholders remain (demo until IDs set); LanguageCard phone mismatch FIXED in 02b via shared whatsappUrl.
External social destinations not live-verified; manual screen-reader/Firefox/WebKit checks not run.
No backend, database, MCP, AI, retention, security or deployment tests are claimed as passing.
